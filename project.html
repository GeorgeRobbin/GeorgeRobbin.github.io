              <h1>A BIG SHORT ROUND 2?</h1>
              <p>Following the pandemic, low interest rates and limited supply of new housing contributed to substantial increases in the price of housing in the US, experiencing double-digit growth every month from August 2020 through till July 2022. Despite the signs of a bubble waning, the question still stands about what will happen next.

                This project presents data on key market determinants, namely house prices, mortgages and housing supply to build a picture of the current state of the US real estate market. Within these visualisations, I also aim to build a comparison between current day statistics and data from 2008 when the US real estate market crashed.</p>

      <p>Decades of low intrest rates and a pandemic that left people wanting more space have both contributed to massive increases in House Prices in the US. Following the trends in the data, we wouldent expect this increase to continue to the extennt it has in 2023, a key factor why is the increase in mortgage rates.</p>

        <p>The first chart here illustartes that mortgage rates are rising and also the hilights the relationship between mortgage rates and house prices. As mortgage rates climb, it becomes harder to finance a home purchase. Chart 2 builds on this presenting a heatmap of Debt-to-Income ratio from 2008 and 2022. We can see that despite higher mortgage rates, debt levels remain lower. One suggestion as to why is shown in chart 3, illustrating that those with lower credit scores have almost been excluded from getting mortages since 2008.</span></h3>

        <p>The housing shortage has led to a decline in demand for homes due to increasing mortgage rates making them unaffordable at current prices. The current 'months supply' measure is at 4.0 which when compared to 11.0 in 2008 is considered very tight, suggesting prices may continue to rise.</p>

        <p >In comparison to the 2008 crash, lower level's of supply and stricter borrowing conditon's means the housing market is unlikely to crash anytime soon, much to the annoyance of michael burry. </p>

        <p>The majority of the Data used in this project was taken from FRED. By installing the FRED API directly into a python workbook, i was able to simultaneosuly search and filter the entire FRED database for specific series. When data was not available from FRED, I used pandas to load it directly into python where i could manipulate data into desired format. The most common issue was the format of the date/time variable, which i overcame by using the PeriodIndex function. Another common issue was the format of State names, with diffrennt data sources usinng different formats. To overcome this i employed dictionary that mapped column ID '0' to the state name 'Alabama' etc. For the scraper i implemented, both columns included , and "" within the values which would create issues when exporting the scraped data to a csv. To overcome this i used .str replace function.</p>
